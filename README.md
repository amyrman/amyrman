### Hey you! 👋😄

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - Being as good a parent, partner, friend and fellow human as I possibly can. 🙏
  - Improving how to structure stuff.
  - Finishing my remote higher vocational education in web and systems development @ Lernia Piteå (by June 2023).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Something new everyday!
  - To code things on the web, mainly with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Java.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - From the smallest interesting projects...
  - ...through to large visions like improving society.
- 💬 Ask me about:
  - Beginner frontend through to backend Javascript, HTML, CSS, frameworks like React, Next, and soon(ish) Java as well!
  - Agile work philosophy and Scrum methodology
  - Whatever you like and we'll take it from there! I'm curious by nature, and I love to help out and get inspired by people sharing their dreams and visions! For example, I know some things about social work (e.g. psychology, sociology...I got a degree in social work).
